Camagru is an instagram like.
To use it, Simple !

You must have docker on your local machine. Then go the root of the copy and then :

docker-compose up -d

Now you can go to your browser and just take a look at localhost.

I couldn't use any frameword and has to do it pure php, js, and html and wasn't familiar with MVC at the beginning of the project,
So there might have few mistakes :)

Have fun

PS: To close just do : docker-compose down
